        "# **Recap**\n",
        "## 1. SVD:\n",
        "Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a matrix factorization technique that breaks down a matrix A into three matrices: \n",
        "A = U . S . V^T , where:\n",
        "\n",
        "U (Left Singular Vectors) – Captures important row patterns. \n",
        "\n",
        "S (Singular Values) – Represents importance (energy) of each component. \n",
        "\n",
        "Vᵀ (Right Singular Vectors) – Captures important column patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "SVD can be used in image compression (lossy), dimensionality reduction, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### **Limitations**: \n",
        "1. When data has non-linear relationship. \n",
        "\n",
        "2. When an image has sudden changes and sharp edges, like images of text.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2. t-sne:\n",
        "t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) is a non-linear dimensionality reduction technique used to visualize high-dimensional data in 2D or 3D. It takes high dimensional data (eg., 100D) and maps it to 2D or 3D by keeping similar points together.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### **Advantage**: Works amazing for data with non-linear relationship, hence it overcomes the first limitation of SVD.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 3. DCT:\n",
        "DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform) is a mathematical transformation used for image and signal compression by converting data into frequency components.\n",
        "\n",
        "It breaks the data into frequency components (low & high frequencies). Then, it keeps important (low-frequency) parts and removes less important (high-frequency) parts.\n",
        "\n",
        "Difference between SVD and DCT: DCT works in the frequency domain (An image in the frequency domain means that it represents the variation of pixel intensities rather than the pixels themselves) while SVD works in the matrix domain.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### **Advantage**: Works good for images with sudden changes and sharp edges, like images of text. Hence, it overcomes the second limitation of SVD."
