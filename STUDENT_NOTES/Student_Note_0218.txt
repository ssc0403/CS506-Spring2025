The limitation of DBSCAN:

-cannot have a good performance on high dense dataset.

Error of two images:
the labels should change

Same MinPts:
Lower Eps means cluster  may more separate. 
Higher Eps means cluster may more concentrated. 


Silhoette Scores:
ai: the distance from point i to every other point in its cluster.

bi: smallest mean distance from point i to every point in another cluster. 

close to 1: good cluster result.

close to 0: may have some overlaps. 

close to -1: sample cluster may be some error
