to predict x, need to know
-what factors influence x (and how so (positively/negatively))
-which factors affect more than others

confirmation bias - too small of a sample size to accurately represent the rule (infinitely many patterns to match sample), rules may change over time

positive examples - examples that follow hypothesis (assuming my hypothesis is true, x will follow)
negative examples - examples that do not follow hypothesis (under the hypothesis, x will be false)
 = tendency to choose positive examples, need to use negative examples to prove hypothesis = rule


unsupervised learning - finding structure/patterns in data (linear algebraic properties, what does it tell about the data)
supervised learning - making predictions on data
